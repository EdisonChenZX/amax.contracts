content_title: About System Contracts
---

The AMAX blockchain platform is unique in that the features and characteristics of the blockchain built on it are flexible, that is, they can be changed, or modified completely to suit each business case requirement. Core blockchain features such as consensus, fee schedules, account creation and modification, token economics, block producer registration, voting, multi-sig, etc., are implemented inside smart contracts which are deployed on the blockchain built on the AMAX platform.

## System contracts defined in amax.contracts

Armoniax implements and maintains AMAX open source platform which contains, as an example, the system contracts encapsulating the base functionality for an AMAX based blockchain.
